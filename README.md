# BonksAndZaps
Final Project for CS12320 - A Simulation of Bonks and Zaps.

As the final project for a module, I had to create a game similar to Conway’s Game of Life that our Lecturer had come up with, called “Bonks and Zaps”. Bonks and Zaps live in a grid, bonks reproduce together, Zaps kill bonks, both move each cycle.

As well as completing the main part of the assignment, we were awarded extra marks for flair. I gave the Zaps basic “morality” – the more bonks they killed, the less likely they were to commit the murder. I also added the ability to fire the Zaps, upon which the program would generate a random backstory of what happened to the fired Zap.

My main challenge was creating a scalable generated grid within a console based environment, creating the entire program from scratch and coming up with a good system for the backstories.
